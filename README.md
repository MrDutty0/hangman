# Ruby Hangman

This project is a component of the [Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming) offered by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Guidelines

In this Hangman game, a word ranging from 5 to 12 letters is randomly selected from a text file. Your objective is to guess one letter per turn. To emerge victorious, you must uncover all the letters in the word without exceeding 7 incorrect guesses.

Furthermore, you have the option to save your game progress, which will be stored in a file. Prior to starting a new game, you can opt to load a previously saved game.
